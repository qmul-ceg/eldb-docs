# Setting Up CEG-VPN Access
## Download your zip file
You should have received an email containing a URL link to download a zip file containing your CEG-VPN3 login details.  This is sensitive information, so save it to your secured home location in your .ssh folder or a dedicated OpenVPN folder. For instance:  
*C:\Users\{USERNAME}\OpenVPN*  
*C:\Users\{USERNAME}\.ssh*  
*/Users/{USERNAME}/.ssh*  
*/Users/{USERNAME}/OpenVPN*  

The URL is only live for 48 hours, so please download the file as soon as possible.Â  If you miss the deadline contact me to generate another URL for you.

The zip file contains the following files:

- **auth.txt** -- your VPN username and password
- **{USERNAME}.png** -- your OTP QR code
- **{USERNAME}.ovpn** -- your VPN config file containing the necessary keys
- **{USERNAME}** -- (no file extension) additional OTP information

These files will enable you to setup a connection to the CEG-VPN3 using a VPN client (OpenVPN Client or Tunnelblick) + authentication using an OTP authorisation phone app (eg 2FAS, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy etc).  This is slightly different to the Duo Mobile 'PUSH' method that was used for CEG-VPN2, but will probably be familiar from other OTP authorisations.

## Setup your OTP authenticator
You will need an [OTP Authenticator](../Connection/Required_Software.md/#OTP-Authenticator) installed on your smart phone.  In your OTP app:

- Open the {USERNAME}.png file to display the QR code.
- Follow the instructions specific to your OTP Authenticator app to add a new account or service using the QR code.
- Skip any step that asks you to retype the displayed number.
- If wanted, edit the account or service name to a better description, eg "CEG-VPN3"

## Setup your VPN client
You will need a [VPN Client](../Connection/Required_Software.md/#VPN-Client) installed on your laptop or PC.
