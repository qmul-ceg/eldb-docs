# East London Database
This is the documentation site for the East London Database 2025, maintained by the **Clinical Effectiveness Group** at Queen Mary University of London. It provides information on using this data resource.

The East London Database is a series of annual databases containing data from the 1st April for patients registered with GP practices within north east London on that date. The coverage has expanded over the years to now include all practices in the North East London ICB area (City & Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Barking & Dagenham, and Havering).

- eldb2014 – eldb2019: contain data obtained from EMIS for inner east London. Hosted in MS Access and not currently available to external analysts.
- eldb2020: contains data from EMIS for inner east London. It is hosted and available to external analysts on our ELDB SQL Server.
- eldb2021 – onwards: contains data from our copy of the Discovery Data Service for all North East London. It is hosted and available to external analysts on our ELDB SQL Server.

Each year contains tables providing the earliest and/or latest codes for the standard QOF registers and clinical measures (Blood Pressure, HbA1c etc) as well as additional register, activity, and status tables. We have made changes and improvements to the schema and included tables for the database each year.

This guide provides information on the data and schema specifically for East London Database 2025 (`eldb2025`). For previous years, please use:
